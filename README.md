# StepfordFly üöÇ

StepfordFly is a Python-based autopilot for the train simulator game "Stepford County Railway", using screen capture and OCR to automate train controls.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This script is for **educational purposes only**. Using it may violate the game's terms of service and could lead to penalties. **Use at your own risk.**

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Automated Speed Control:** Maintains speed based on the current limit.
*   **Signal Detection:** Detects red, green, yellow, and double-yellow signals and reacts accordingly.
*   **Message Handling:** Responds to in-game messages like "Close Doors" and "Depart".
*   **Automatic Braking:** Applies brakes when approaching a station or a red signal.

## üîß How It Works

The script continuously performs a loop of the following actions:

1.  **Capture:** Takes screenshots of specific areas of the game screen.
2.  **Preprocess:** Converts the captured images to a format suitable for OCR and color detection.
3.  **Detect & OCR:** Reads text (like speed and distance) using Tesseract OCR and detects signal colors.
4.  **Control:** Sends keyboard commands to the game to control the train based on the gathered information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. Tesseract OCR

You need to install the Tesseract OCR engine.

*   **Windows:** Download from [Tesseract-OCR GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
*   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
*   **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install tesseract`

### 2. Python Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pytesseract opencv-python numpy Pillow pyautogui
```

### 3. Nix Shell (Optional)

If you use Nix, you can run `nix-shell` in the project directory to get a shell with all the dependencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure it for your screen setup.

### 1. Screen Regions

The script needs to know where to look on the screen. Use the calibration tool to find the coordinates of the game's UI elements:

```bash
python calibrate.py
```

Move your mouse to the top-left and bottom-right corners of each UI element (like the speedometer) and note the coordinates. Then, update the `REGIONS` dictionary in `config.py` with these values.

### 2. Tesseract Path (if needed)

If `pytesseract` can't find Tesseract, set the `TESSERACT_CMD_PATH` in `config.py` to the location of your Tesseract executable.

### 3. Color Ranges

The script detects signal lights based on HSV color ranges. If the default colors are not detected correctly, you may need to adjust the `COLOR_RANGES` in `config.py`.

## üöÄ Usage

To run the autopilot, navigate to the project's parent directory and run it as a module:

```bash
python3 -m StepfordFly.main
```

Make sure the game is running and is the active window.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

*   More sophisticated control logic (e.g., dynamic braking).
*   A simple GUI for easier configuration.
*   Support for more in-game events and messages.
